#Bloccit#

This application, which is a Reddit Clone, taught me the fundamentals of web development with Ruby on Rails.

Bloccit users may add posts to topics, add comments to posts, favorite posts, upvote and downvote posts, and edit their own posts. Administrative user can create new topics, as well as all other actions. Posts are scoped according to two factors: time of creation and popularity among other users.

Highlights:

* Authorization from Scratch

* User roles from Scratch

* Bootstrap

* Factory Girl and Shoulda Gems

* Plenty of Rspecs

* Glyphicons

* Sessions

* MySql

* MVC's

* TDD
